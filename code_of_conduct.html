    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    
    <p>
        <span class="emphasis">Kent Beck (thinkies.org)</span> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Please treat your fellow Thinkies World Congress participants with respect, regardless of the context you're interacting with them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Harassment is not appropriate for any conference venue. We expect all Thinkies World Congress participants to follow the Code of Conduct during the conference. This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and social media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the conference without a refund, and/or banned from future Thinkies World Congress events, at the discretion of Thinkies World Congress organizers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, sexualized images or language in public spaces, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. Speaker presentations fall under this category and should not use images or examples that would violate the code of conduct.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Thinkies World Congress participants must remember that Thinkies World Congress organizers and volunteers are not trained conflict resolution specialists, nor are they security or law enforcement. Thinkies World Congress organizers and volunteers will immediately escalate issues around safety, violence, or similar situations to event venue staff or law enforcement. For the protection of Thinkies World Congress participants, Thinkies World Congress will never put its organizers or volunteers in the position of trying to assess whether or not an incident merits escalation. If there is any doubt, we will escalate incidents to the appropriate agency immediately.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Incident Resolution:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>All Thinkies World Congress participants agree to treat each other with respect, regardless of whether you are in a session room or at the event venue facilities.</li>
        <li>Simple disagreements should be resolved between the individuals concerned.</li>
        <li>Harassment or more serious issues should be escalated to a Thinkies World Congress organizer or volunteer. That person will immediately contact a Thinkies World Congress organizer who has the responsibility to assist in resolution.</li>
        <li>Thinkies World Congress participants suffering outright assault or extreme harassment should contact the event venue staff immediately, or a Thinkies World Congress organizer if they're nearby. That person will immediately escalate the issue to the event venue staff or law enforcement as appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
